We buy stuff, With our phones, with our cards. and sometimes even with a single swipe. Why cant there be a receipt that gets send back to your phone/account to keep track of it all? 


#### EARLY ALPHA SPECIFICATION.
Development of E-Receipt is something we want to make open-source. since it will require work from everyone to get correctly implemented.
